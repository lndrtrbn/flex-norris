# Flex Norris

The goal is to illustrate how we can use CSS Flexbox to easily build UI.

## Branches

- `master` contains all the code I've written so far,
- `01-empty-ui` checkpoint with blank UI that you can use to create your own.

## Run the app

```sh
npm run dev # or
yarn dev
```

## Data

The data comes from the API https://api.chucknorris.io/.
